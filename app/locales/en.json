    "text": [
      "I'm currently a student at ENSA Tangier — not because I dreamed of becoming an engineer, but because I knew I needed an environment that matched my mindset. After the cybersecurity & networks program I was in got canceled, and a disappointing year at FP Larache, I decided to shift toward something I could truly enjoy and grow in.",
      "My passion lies in cybersecurity and AI. I love building digital tools — websites, apps, scripts — and automating tasks using AI tools like ChatGPT and Cursor. I don't just use them to build — I use them to learn. They've helped me realize that with a basic understanding and a hands-on mindset, you can build almost anything.",
      "My goal is to become one of the best at using AI to build things, solve problems, automate work, and earn a living efficiently. I work fast, think sharp, and sometimes act recklessly — but I learn from every step, and I'm always moving forward toward what's next."
